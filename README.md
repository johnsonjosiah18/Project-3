# project-3

Our project idea was to have a user friendly map that allows you to see statistics on each state. The data we used was crime, population, median house cost, and property tax rates.

The Project-3 ipynb file contains the code that was used to clean and manipulate the data into a dataframe. We then exported those dataframes into csv files that were then imported in Pgadmin 4. Once imported into pg admin the files were then converted into json documents to be loaded into the leaflet visualisation. Our leaflet visual gives the user the ability to move the courser over any state. They also can choose what statistic they would like to see. 

All the files are in one place due to referencing our code. The csv files that are cleaned are the property_taxes and the two other csvs that contain FINAL. The rest are the ones that were cleaned originally.
Additionally there is a cleaning snip of some of the original data that had to be cleaned. 

The finding and cleaning of the data was preformed by Marissa Saucedo, Josiah Johnson, and William Nzoiwu.
